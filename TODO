-Check more return codes
-Check for NULL function pointers in player functions before calling
	-Probably also when loading the player function sets
-Check that nothing exposed to the AI can cause a fatal error
-Verify that nothing passed to player functions is integral to actual game state
	buyStock is OK
	mergerSurvivor is OK
	mergerTrade- (not used yet)
	All others are fine (no extra pointers)
-Add a function that just verifies the current board state is valid (no touching chains, no non-chain tiles touching chains)
	Touching non-chain tiles are OK, so long as they're <= # of players- could be result of initial game setup
-Update player function requirements to add an "init" function, to do any one-time initialization
-Improve HALE python module to actually load values from C
